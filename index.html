				Owen awoke to the sound of talons and hooves scrambling on the floors below him. Owen was a Luxio, and was currently the only able postmon stationed at this office that wasn’t in the Dodrio or Gogoat evolution lines. 

				Owen yawned, and then went down to retrieve breakfast for himself. He also grabbed a second meal for his old leader, the Ampharos shining his beam of light into the storm, searching endlessly for something out there. Owen placed the food in front of him, but the Ampharos paid no attention, still lost in his fruitless search.

				By the time Owen had climbed back down, most of the mailbags destined for the more remote and interesting places had already been taken. This left only a few local deliveries, and deliveries to more dangerous places. Owen was feeling rather inattentive, so he decided to take one of the easy ones.

				Owen didn’t come to the west side of town often, and there was a clear reason why. Too many fire types. Most of the buildings had bits of charred wood here and there, and some were even falling apart. Owen found the sloppily built hut he had a delivery for, but there was no mailbox, not even a slot in the shabby door. He’d have to deliver it in person. 

				. . .

				Wasabi the Flareon was awoken with a start as someone knocked his door off its hinges... again. “A letter for Wasabi?” Owen's voice sounded through the door. The Flareon dragged himself to the doorway, hungover and refusing to get up properly.

				“A luxio? I thought -hic- you were all-”

				“In the words of our postmaster, ‘Any mon with a working set o’ legs can be a postmon.’ It’s just that most species barely apply, and I usually don’t deliver to this area” Owen sat down and used his foreleg to rummage around in his mailbag before retrieving the letter and handing it to Wasabi. “There. Now please sign so I can get to the rest of these deliveries...”

				Wasabi waited for the Luxio to be out of sight before opening the letter. It was a bill. After yelling some swears a bit too loudly, his focus came back to the bill. In his anger Wasabi considered burning it up, but either way he’d have to pay his debt, so it would be better to keep it. However, Wasabi hadn’t worked in months, and he had almost exhausted his supply of Poké. This debt was to completely bankrupt him, so there was one thing he could do. Wasabi needed a job, and a stable one at that. 

				. . .

				Cynder the cyndaquil was a quick learner, figuring out how things worked on the storm continent soon after washing ashore, and most of the town had been very hospitable to him since his arrival. However, after the previous night, Cynder wanted to keep his distance from the other fire type pokemon. A bar had gotten burned to the ground because of their negligence, and he didn’t want to be associated that. Reckless use of fire had hurt Cynder in the past, so he refused to even use his fire at all. Any sort of destruction and violence was off the list too. Cynder had trouble finding a job that didn’t involve fire. Most employers were looking to use each Pokemon’s elemental powers, and had laughed when he refused to show them how strong his flames were.

				While he was wandering about, Cynder noticed a particular flareon walking toward the post office. Normally this wouldn't be of any concern, but this was the same pokemon who had burned down the bar the previous night.

				Cynder decided to follow him to make sure he didn't cause any trouble.

				Wasabi spat some embers on the ground and watched them burn, but Cynder quickly ran up to stamp them out before they could get out of hand. “Are you planning to burn down more buildings‽”

				“I’m planning to burn down the next place that rejects me,” Wasabi said sarcastically. “They all think I can’t control my fire.”
				 
				“Well you obviously can’t, considering what happened last night.”

				“Alcohol boosts my firepower.”

				“...No, it doesn’t.”

				Just then, a Doduo ran past, interrupting their thoughts. They were both standing in front of the post office, a facility that was always hiring, and they both needed a job. Wasabi sped in to search for the postmaster, with Cynder following close behind to make sure he didn’t start a fire.

				. . .

				“‘Any mon with a working set o’ legs can be a postmon.’ That's what the Luxio had said.”

				“...And?" The postmaster, a Dodrio, questioned him.

				“I want a job.”

				“But you’re the local drunk.”

				“I am.”

				“And is that you’re drinking buddy?” The postmaster responded, unimpressed.

				“We only met yesterday!” Cynder piped up before any negative opinions could be made of him. “...But I would still like a job.”

				The Dodrio sighed in defeat. "Well, we aren't technically allowed to turn anyone down, so..."

				One of his heads picked up a mailbag with its beak and dropped it in front of the duo.
				“We have some deliveries to the volcanic region that nobody has taken yet, and you’re both fire types. Just take the main road, and you should get there with no trouble." 

				“What about payment?” The Flareon inquired. He wanted to make sure he would be able to clear his debt in a reasonable amount of time.

				“I’m sure nobody else is hiring you! So you should just take what you get” another head spoke impatiently. “Just go deliver the mail, we’ll talk money once you're done.”

				“Ok, we’ll go then.” Cynder didn’t want this drag on any longer than it had to.

				“If you take advantage of my problems, I will burn this place down”

				“I could probably mark you as an outlaw just for that threat! But I will take the challenge of reforming you. Later. For now, just get out of my office, and go do your newly appointed job. I don’t have the time to deal with your attitude right now”

				. . . 

				The duo of fire types headed west out of town into the volcanic region. “I haven’t been out of town much, how is the rest of the storm continent? I hope there’s a more serious fire department in the other towns.” Cynder tried to converse with his companion while throwing shade at his reckless use of fire.

				“Other towns? You know that Lazulum is the last bastion of civilization!” 

				“Really?”

				“Nah, theres fort crag, but I doubt you’d find any law enforcement there. Also there's a bunch of weirdos out east, but I’ve never gone out there” Wasabi stopped for a moment to think, causing Cynder to bump into him. Wasabi turned around excitedly “hey we should take this shortcut I know! It’s fun, and we’ll finish our job faster!”

				“I’m not going off the main road with you, you’re a psycho pyromaniac!”

				“And your parents couldn’t think of a less cliche name!”

				“What?”

				“What?”

				Wasabi took a second to think before he tackled Cynder and pulled his mailbag off, then he ran down the path he had indicated before. Cynder gave chase, but soon after he started down the path something felt different. It was strange, he couldn’t visually see any difference but something had changed for sure. 

				. . .

				It wasn’t long before Cynder found Wasabi, and the Flareon in question was currently scratching up a defenseless Magby, Cynder inhaled deeply before blowing a smokescreen to temporarily blind Wasabi and pulling the Magby out of harm's way. “There, I saved yo-” the Magby socked Cynder right in the face. Wasabi charged out of the smokescreen at full speed with his entire body set ablaze, he rammed headfirst into the Magby with such force that it was knocked out of the room. “What was that!” Cynder exclaimed outraged “You can’t just go about attacking random pokemon!”

				“Wait… you’ve never been in a dungeon before?” Wasabi was genuinely confused with Cynder. “Did the world outside the storms find a way to remove dungeons?”

				“...We’re in a dungeon?” Cynder started to become panicked “I was always told to stay away from dungeons, I gotta get out!” Cynder sped back the way he came and hit a dead end. “Ah, but the path was just here…”

				“You never learned about how they work either? I thought dungeons were common knowledge, maybe they should teach about them in schools… Anyway, we just have to force our way through. It’s a much shorter path through here, and more fun.”

				“Depends on your definition of ‘fun’”

				“Beating random dungeon pokemon senseless?”

				“Yeah no, just get us through, as it’s your fault we’re in here”

				“Relax, nothing here can hurt me,” Wasabi said smugly as Pansear stepped out of the shadows to spew fire at him. Most of it was absorbed into his fur while the rest just flowed off him like water. “This dungeon is a cakewalk for me.”

				“You don’t understand fire control, you’re a drunk, and full of yourself. What else do I need for the list?”

				“Shut it.”

				. . . 

				“I’ve defeated at least a dozen of these guys solo, so you’re pretty useless.” Wasabi glared over his shoulder at his ‘useless’ partner, Cynder gave no response other than returning the glare. “Oh, that should bring us to the final area.” Wasabi indicated a path, but Cynder couldn’t see any difference between the paths Wasabi had been pointing out and all the normal paths. However, he did have the same feeling as when he entered the dungeon, like the world was shifting around him. Cynder looked around the new area curiously. 

				“Why is this room so large?” he asked worriedly. Just then, a Camerupt stepped out of the shadows.

				“Oh.”

				“...I was not notified that a boss had moved in,” Wasabi noted as he hopped to the side to avoid a pillar of stone rising up where he just was. Wasabi continued to hop around avoiding attacks while spitting fire. “IF MY ‘PARTNER’ WASN’T SO USELESS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOME DAMAGE.”

				“You want me to help? Here.” Cynder sarcastically drew in a breath and blew out a small cloud of smoke “I’m not using fire, and he’s just attacking you anyway” 

				“Well that’s your mistake!” Wasabi paused to say. Which turned out to be Wasabi’s Mistake, a mistake that allowed the Camerupt’s next mini earthquake to entomb the Flareon. The Camerupt turned to Cynder with the ever present anger of a dungeon pokemon in its eyes. 

				“Now, since I didn’t mindlessly attack you, can you just let me pass?” Cynder was oblivious to how dungeons worked for sure.

				. . .

				Cynder woke up to find himself slumped up against Wasabi’s side, the flareon was lying on the ground but was clearly awake. Neither of them had the energy to move, and a darkness seemed to cover the area around them. Noticing Cynder was conscious Wasabi turned to look him in the eye.

				“Do you think anyone in town cares enough to save us?” Wasabi’s words surprised Cynder, they lacked any of the harshness or hostility he had before.
				 
				“what do you mean?” Cynder was slightly confused at this shift in attitude

				“Will anyone notice we’re gone... and will they care enough to save us?” The Flareon clarified. “I...”

				“Huh?”

				“...Nevermind.”
